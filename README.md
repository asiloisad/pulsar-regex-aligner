# regex-aligner

Align text by regex statment.

## Installation

After the announcement of Atoms sunset, the official [Atom packages store](https://atom.io/packages) isn't respond properly, so latest version of this package cannot be downloaded there. To get latest version run the shell command

    apm install bacadra/atom-regex-aligner

and obtain the package directly from Github repository. Please note that package will occur in `Settings/Packages/Git Packages` instead of `Community Packages`.
